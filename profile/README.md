This organization is building a 3d computational geometry ecosystem for rust.\
Our projects:
<!-- todo make these links -->
- [geo-3d](https://github.com/TimTheBig/geo-3d) - computational geometry algorithmes
- [csgrs](https://github.com/timschmidt/csgrs) - openSCAD like Constructive Solid Geometry using BSP trees
- [rita](https://github.com/glennDittmann/rita) - Randomized Incremental Delaunay triangulations
